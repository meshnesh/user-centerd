#UX Centered Design.  
The point of **POET** is to advocate a user-centered design.Design should be based in each way in the interests of the user and making the products usable and understandable.
How does the designer go about the task? the principles of design are straightforward.  
These are the 7 principles of transforming difficult tasks into simple ones: 

  #####Use both knowledge in the world and in the head  
When a user is able to internalize the required knowledge, performance can be faster and more efficient.Thus design should not impede action,it should enable  one to use internal and external knowledge without hustle and interferance.  The operation of any device depends on it's conceptual model. The designer therefore must develop a model that will be readily and easily understandable by the user and that potrays the current state of the system. The designer and user models may be similar, however they communicate through the system itself(system image).

  #####Simplify the structure of tasks 
  Tasks should be simple and clear in structure, minimizing the amount of planning or problem solving the user will require. This is where the designer should pay attention to the psychology of the person it terms of;  
    a. The memory limitations, whether long term or short term. if necessary, the system should provide technological assistance for any temporary memory requirements.A major role of new technology should be to make tasks simpler. A task's structure may be re-organised through technology, or technlogical aids may be provided to reduce mental load. Four major technological approaches can be followed:

    a. Keep the task much the same, but provide mental aids:  
    > mental aids can be real helpful when one is dealing with a number of tasks, where we cannot trust our own memory structures. Some mental aids are also technical advances including watches and computer alarms.  
    
    b. Use tech. to make visible what otherwise would be invisible:  
    > Considering technological devices for support do not change the tasks, but they do make visible or provide ways of getting information on what is happening reducing pursuits which wouldn't be possible
    
    c. Automate, but keep the task similar.  
    > There are dangers in simplification. where unless we are careful, automation may harm as well as help. The task will stay essentially the same, but part of it will disappear. Consider the case of automobile automation, with the gear shifting releived, most drivers just care about getting to a place so the need to monitor engine speed and gearshift position would seem quite irrelevant.
    
    d. Change the nature of the task.  
    > When a task seems complex because of maybe the manual skill required to complete, certain technological aids can dramatically change which type of skill is required by reconstructing the task, or having a different point of view. For instance in a construction site, the workers could use crane machines to do all the heavy lifting instead of using like 5 or 10 guys or even more to load or do some lifting.
    
    
   #####Make things visible
 Good design should enable the person to know what is possible, how actions should be done and the effects of their actions. The system state should also be visible and readily interpretable, this make the outcomes of an action obvious.
 
  #####Get the mappings right
Exploit natural mappings.Make sure the user can determine the relationships:    
a. Between intentions and possible actions.  
b. Between actions and theior effects on the system.  
c. Between actual system state and what is perceivable.  
d. Between the perceived state and the needs, intentions and expectations of the user.

  #####Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial
Constraints should be used so that the user feels as if there is only one possible thing to do- the right thing.They should reduce the number of alternative actions at each step to at most a few.    

 #####Design for error
A designer should assume that any error that can be made will be made. The designer should also try to support the user's response even when wrong while allowing the user to recover from errors. Make it easy to reverse operations at the same time make it hard to do irreversible actions.

  #####When all else fails, standardize
When something can't be designed without arbitrary mappings and difficulties, there is one last route: standardize.Make related actions work in the same way, standardize the system and problem.  
There are various difficulties that may be experienced for instance, it may be hard to obtain an agreement, timing is crucial thus it is important to standardize as soon as possible but late enough to take into account advanced tech and procedures.  

**Manuals**  
Manuals are suppossed to be a guide to a particular system, but most manuals are rather less helpful than they should be. Written hastily after the product is designed to avoid time pressure, with insufficient resources and by overworked people.  
Not many users take time and read manuals as they should but it is obvious one cannot operate a complex device without at least some instructions, thus they should be not only informative but easy to understand and manipulate practically.  
Manuals should be written before the system design and the ones responsible to follow the specifics of it.For in some cases the manual or the system may contain additional information which would lead to confusion.  

**Deliberately making things difficult:**  
If good design is not ignored in some contexts, the purpose for the existence of the system will be nullified. This may be effective in areas where:  
1. security is a major issue and privacy needs to be reserved at a clearance level.  
2. Dangerous operations are carried out and require more than one person to complete.  
Usually, there is one difficult part, designed to keep unauthorized people from using a device, the rest should follow the normal principles of design.   

**Easy looking is not necessarilly easy to use:**  
Apparent complexity and actual complexity are not all the same. E.g. a telephone which is simple looking but hard to use compared to a car's dashboard, all the panels, buttons but easy to drive the vehicle.  
The problem is that when there are more actions than controls, each control must take part in a variety of different actions. If there are exactly the same number of controls as actions, then, in principle, the
controls can be simple and the execution can be simple: find the correct control and activate it.  
To make something easy to use, match the number of controls to the number of functions and organize the panel. To make something look easy, minimize the number of controls. Thus to make the two conflicting requirements be met simultaneously, hide control panels that aren't being used at the moment.  

**Design and Society**  
Tools affect more than the ease with which we do things; they can affect our view of ourselves, society and the world. It may be hardly necessary to point out the changes in society that resulted from various inventions. Even simple inventions can bring a lot of changes, most of which cannot be predicted e.g. the telephone which is one thing a lot of people cannot live without.  

**The Design of Everyday Things.**  
Design affecting society is hardly news to designers. Many take their work seriously but manipulation of the society has severe drawbacks. Thus design takes on political significance. In western countries, design has reflected a lot in the marketplace with emphasis on the exterior features deemed to be attractive to the purchaser thus taste is not the criterion in marketting expensive stuff, but design.  
Everyday tasks aren't difficult beacuse of their complexity, but of the poor design which may lead to straining in understanding. The dificulties can be avoided through good design.  
Errors are also an unavoidable part of everyday life. Proper design can help decrease incidence of errors by,  
a. Eliminating the causes of errors  
b. Minimizing the possibilities of others  
c. Helping to make errors discoverable once they have been made, e.g. pop ups when one doesn't give a similar password while changing.  
We do not have to experience confusion or suffer from undiscovered errors, proper design can make a difference in our quality of life.
